This is a project on **#30DaysOfKotlin** program by **Google**. This Kotlin program calculates BMI and displays health status based on the weight and the height.

The motivation and inspiration behind this project is the Google's **#30DaysOfKotlin** program. As Kotlin is a *highly expressive language* and the same has attracted me towards it!
